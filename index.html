            <p>The Industrial Revolution, indisputably enhanced large-scale factory manufacturing and operating methods,
              as well as introducing new machinery, new power sources and more productive and effective ways of
              organizing work. As a result, there were more goods manufactured and sold.</p>

        <p>However, industrialisation also had a harmful effect on society. Rapid urbanization, terrible living
          conditions, the spread of deadly
          diseases and an increase in crime rates were all part of it. Families were forced by factories to move
          into urban areas in order to work and earn an income. Without a well-organized police force and factories,
          warehouses and shops full of goods, towns and cities became the hotspot for crime and violence. </p>

        <p>Fears and concerns that machinery might deprive people of their jobs increased. Many people turned to crime
          as a way
          to improve their poor living conditions and low-income. Furthermore, because of the low life expectancy in
          industrial cities, orphans were widespread, thus they often turned to crime to make ends meet. During in
          the Industrial Revolution, majority of people often lived cramped conditions, with open sewers and garbage
          scattered streets.</p>

            <span>Analyse</span>
            <p>
              As crime rates increased, poverty and poor living conditions increased. Workers were frequently sacked;
              police were often disregarded, and hundreds of banks became targets. There were many crimes that people
              committed and at least 200 were punishable by death. Yet, there were three major crimes; rape, murder and
              theft/pick pocketing. For women, the most common offence was prostitution. In order to gain some money and
              feed their family, they had no other choice.

      <h2>Theft/Pickpocketing</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/theft.jpg" />
      <p>Increased standardization of goods triggered abilities for theft and embezzlement. Pickpocketing was one of the
        most common types of theft in industrial towns. This was often performed by young boys and worked well in
        overcrowded streets and places. These pick pockets needed to be skilful, so they do not find themselves in jail
        or worse. They typically stole purses, watches, pocket handkerchiefs and pins. Henry Mayhew reported in his book
        London Labour and the London Poor , children, even as young as five years old, were taught by older thieves. “A
        coat… hanging on the wall with a bell attached to it…” was one method of training future pickpockets. The child
        then try to remove the handkerchief from the coat’s pocket while the bell is still ringing. They are not
        regarded well taught until they can do this proficiently.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="murder">
      <h2>Murder</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/garott.jpg" />
      <p>Prior to the Industrial Revolution, murder was not a common crime. However, during the Industrial Revolution,
        people’s attraction in such crime grew after a series of successful garrotting. This sparked public outrage and
        interest in murder trials. A garrotter was someone who half-strangled their victim so that it would be easier to
        rob. In the 1880s, a serial killer known as Jack the Ripper piqued the public’s fear in murder and terrified the
        police. His victims were mainly among the lowest class of society, prostitutes from one of the worst slums in
        London, a place called Whitechapel. Despite the fact that he is only accused of killing five people, his
        popularity and significance stem from the society in which he committed the crimes, the brutality of his crimes,
        and his enduring reputation, to which his identity still remains unknown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rape">
      <h2>Rape/Prostitution</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/rape.jpg" />
      <p>Women were increasingly exploited in brothels and on the streets in London, despite the fact that prostitution
        had existed since ancient times. Prostitution of young girls became more popular during the Industrial
        Revolution, according to a Select Committee report from 1882. Lower class women worked alongside men in coal
        mines due to the fact they were in need of jobs and money. Due to the intense heat, women wore very little, and
        the men wore nothing at all in the mines and on many occasions women were raped. As a result, many of the women
        had illegitimate children. Because these women were poor, they were unable to take maternity leave; instead,
        they would work all day, give birth the next night, and then return to the mines within a week.</p>

            <p>In addition to this, children were often punished in factories. They were usually beaten with a strap to
              make them work quicker. In some workplaces, if they became too exhausted to work, they were submerged
              headfirst into the water tanks. Jonathan Downe reported in 1832: "When I was seven years old I went to
              work at Mr. Marshalls factory at Shrewsbury. If a child was drowsy, the overlooker touches the child on
              the shoulder and says, "Come here". In a corner of the room there is an iron cistern filled with water. He
              takes the boy by the legs and dips him in the cistern and sends him back to work."</p>

    <h4>Henry Catlin</h4>
    <p>
      In 1842, Henry was 14 years old when he was sentenced to be transported to Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) for 14
      years. He had stolen 3/6d (17 ½ pence). His father John had also stolen 2/6d (12 ½ pence) in a separate offense
      and had been transported to Prison Hulks for 7 years. Henry stayed in Australia after he had served his sentence
      and eventually died in Victoria 1918.

      John Walker was charged with theft of onions valued at 4 – 5 shillings. He appeared for trial on 8th April 1874

      Between May and July 1876 Lucy was committed and tried for the murder of her 21-day old baby girl. She was found

  <div class="conclusion">
    <p>During the Industrial Revolution, Britain went through some extraordinary economic and societal changes, which
      then eventually had a significant impact on crime. There were warehouses stuffed with merchandise to sell. There
      were banks, where huge amounts of money were kept. There were products strewn about that were being moved from one
      location to another. Burglars found fresh and appealing targets in the homes of those who had made a fortune from
      industry earnings. All of these provided fresh opportunities for crime and theft.</p>
